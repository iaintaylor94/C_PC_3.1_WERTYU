## Problem 3.1: WERTYU [^1]
### Problem description
A common typing error is to press the key one space adjacent to the intended one. This program corrects a message that has been typed offset to the right. Spaces are preserved in the output.

### Example 
>**Input**                      
>O S, GOMR YPFSU/                                                                                                                                                              

>**Output**                             
>I AM FINE TODAY.                                                                                                                                 

### Problem solution
This problem can be fixed simply by using a switch/case block to replace each incorrect letter by the correct one.
